# Data-Camp-fake-news-detection

**Fake news detection**: a kaggle-like competition on the RAMP ecosystem.
Course: Data Camp (Balazs Kegl, Alexandre Gramfort - M2 Data Science).

## Context
Fake news is intentionally written to mislead readers to believe false information, which makes it difficult and nontrivial to detect based on news content. Given the prevalence of this
new phenomenon, "Fake news" was even named the word of the year in 2016.

## Getting Started
Get started on this RAMP with the [dedicated notebook](fake_news_starting_kit.ipynb).
